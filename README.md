# Logic Gates Learning Tool (Tkinter GUI)

This was my **first Python Tkinter project**, built in the first semester of college, designed to help users learn about basic logic gates.

## Features
- 6 Buttons for 6 different logic gates:
  - AND
  - OR
  - NOT
  - NAND
  - NOR
  - XOR
- Clicking each button opens a new window showing:
  - Theory of the logic gate
  - Truth Table
  - Diagram of the logic gate

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Tkinter (GUI library)

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Why I Built This
I built this project to:
- Learn Python GUI programming using Tkinter
- Combine programming with digital electronics
- Create a simple educational tool

## Future Improvements (Optional)
- Add interactive simulations for better understanding
- Include quizzes for practice
- Improve UI/UX design

## License
This project is open-source. Feel free to use, modify, or improve it.
